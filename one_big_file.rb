title("Basics")
# The simplest first program:
# prints the phrase "Hello world"

puts "Hello world"
print "My name is ", "A", "n", "d", "y", "\n"
puts "Thing one", "Thing two"


# Strings, like everything else in Ruby, are objects that can receive messages.
puts "fizz".reverse

title("Numbers")
# Basically math

puts 400 + 20
puts 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
puts 15 % 5 # more on this later

# Numbers, like everything else in Ruby, are objects that can receive messages.

title("Variables")
# Placeholders (buckets) for text, math, and other kinds of values

# Let's put the value "fizz" into a bucket called word.
word = "fizz"

# We can now call the same methods for the string "fizz"
# on the bucket that contains it.

title("Types, Coercion, and Casting")
# Kinds of things and turning them from one to the other 

# Calling puts turns non-strings into strings before
# printing them. This is called coercion.
puts 1234
# The outcome is the same as us casting it first:
puts 1234.to_s

# String "1234" vs. Integer 1,234
puts "1234".class
puts 1234.class
puts "1234" == 1234.to_s # comparison; more on this later

puts "1234".reverse
# This next line will explode if we uncomment it (delete the first '#').
# It's because we're calling #reverse before turning a number into a string:
# puts number.reverse # same as => puts(number.reverse)

# Method chaining to the rescue! Let's cast it into a string,
# then reverse the characters (letters), then give it to puts.
puts number.to_s.reverse 

# Casting Strings to Integers works too, within reason
puts "1234".to_i == 1234

title("Loops, Lists, and Iteration")
# Let's make Ruby repeat itself so we don't have to

# Loops are great ways of doing the same work over and over
# on a collection of things you need worked on.
# You may have seen loops like this in other languages:

puts "while loop:"
num = 1
while num < 31 # more comparison!
  puts num
  num = num + 1
end

# Cool, cool; but we're working *way* harder than we need to.
# Let's pick up two new concepts that will make this easier!
# First one is lists, and the most common kind is an array:

array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] # an array is an explicit list of things
puts "\narray:"
puts array                     # just loops over all of them and prints each one!

# We still have a typing problem though, we have to add any new numbers
# by hand if we need them. What if we could just spell out the ends?

range = (1..10)                # a range is defined by two end points
puts "\nrange:"
puts range                     # but it doesn't automatically print the rest

# The range just prints the endpoints... How do we print each value?
# We *could* use casting to fix this by turning the range into an array.

puts "\nrange.to_a:"
puts range.to_a

# But what if we want more control? Let's add a second tool: blocks.
# We'll use the method 'each' that every list knows...
# and give it work to do to each thing in the list with a block!

puts "\nrange.each - simple:"
range.each { |number| puts number }

# If we want more lines of work in the block, we split it up like this:

puts "\nrange.each - fancier:"
range.each do |number|
  # 'number' here becomes the name for each number inside the range
  # as the block iterates over them. Pretty cool!
  puts "The number is:"
  puts number
end


title("Conditionals")
# How to do work only when you want it done

# What about only printing every even number?

puts "Do one thing or don't do anything:"
range.each { |number| puts number if number.even? }

# We can add another outcome to the same check if it's false:

puts "\nDo one thing or do something else:"
range.each do |number|
  if number.even?
    puts number
  else
    puts "NOPE"  
  end
end


title("Back-to-FizzBuzz")
# The return of our problem to solve

# Let's add another comparision with its own outcome:

puts "Do one thing if it evenly divides by 3,",
     "something else if it evenly divides by 5,",
     "or something else if neither was true:"
range.each do |number|
  if number % 3 == 0

title("Methods")

# We're doing nearly the same work for each branch above except for the number...
