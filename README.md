# Ruby Crash Course

## TL;DR
This project is a collection of Ruby language concepts demonstrated in the context of solving the classic programming exercise "Fizz Buzz". The big idea was to distill the first week of a coding boot camp into a single session that takes people from zero to reading real Ruby code that solves the problem.

## FizzBuzz
We write a program that prints out whole numbers in a sequence, from one to some higher number. Whenever it's evenly divisible by 3 print "fizz", by 5 print "buzz", and by both print "fizzbuzz". Otherwise just print the number itself. The numbered files progressively introduce language concepts and the whole thing can be run in a single sitting by an experienced Rubyist discussing the contents.

## Instructions
On a system with Ruby installed, you can run the quickstart by typing "ruby main.rb" in a terminal.

The material can be covered by reading and running the numbered files in order. The comments document the concepts involved in the code from each file. An experienced Rubyist leading a workshop provide context and answer questions. The presenter can then circle back to the file in the helper directory and discuss requiring code from other files.

## Note
For ease of reading for beginners, classes and modules that are dependencies are grouped in the same files for the most part.

## TODO
Topics yet to cover include: structs, metaprogramming, nil, any kind of deep-dive of standard library features, requiring files in depth, and gems/frameworks. 

## Housekeeping
The code has been tested with Ruby 2.5. This crash-course has been developed by Andrew Neely (@ravinglogic on Twitter and @aneely on Github) with the sponsorship of [Flywheel](getflywheel.com) and is licensed under the MIT license. Attribution is appreciated if you find this useful in introducing more people to Ruby.
