# This is what we'd call a big 'procedure'. It's a literal list of instructions
# that run top to bottom. But this is all it can do. I can count less high by
# deleting lines, but if I want to count higher I have to add lines by hand.
# If I want to print something else, I have to change them all.

# Let's learn some more Ruby to help us, then we'll come back to writing
# a better FizzBuzz program. Open the next file to keep going.
